About:

The nUrveSensor is the first hardware mobile sensor manufactured by Urban Mobile Sensors, LLC.

Hardware Detail:
This code base is designed to run on an Arduino Due boards, but is still under development.
Other boards have been used in the development including the Arduino UNO and Arduino Duemilanove. However, please note that the memory load (SRAM) of this code will exceed the allocation on any board with only 2K of SRAM.

Features:
- Can collect data from 12 sensors through I2C and analog ports
- ... More later 
- 

In addition, we've built in a lot of self reporting so that you can see what's going on as it's going on.

Currently not for release - still in heavy development
